## U of A Deep Dive Analysis Review:

This study provides critical information to stakeholders for catalyzing the growth of an as-yet non-existent geothermal industry in Alberta. On a broader scale, this study provides a case study for quantifying regional scale geothermal resources in sedimentary basins. Although considerable amount of work remains to be done in order to bring a commercial geothermal project to fruition in Alberta, this study conclusively reveals a viable technical and potentially cost competitive geothermal resource base in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

Executive summary table in page 12 of report.

For each potential reservoir identified (above), the study calculated gross thermal and power capacity over a 30 year period. The following types of metrics were used to assess the geothermal potential :

*Thermal power potential (MWt) over a 30 year period
*Electrical power potential (MWe) over a 30 year period
*Flow rate required to producer 1megawatt of gross thermal (MWt) and electric (MWe) power.
*See figures 10 and 11.

Costs (Section 5.2.1)

*Fixed costs of retrofitting a gas well for use as a geothermal slim hole : ~$281,000
*Full cost break-down is found in the attached .csv files
