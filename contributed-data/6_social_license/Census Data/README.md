## @Marc: please edit this file! This is an example ##
These folders contain Canadian census data for 2011 and 2016. We can use these README.md files to add guidance for participants. Ideally we would have only a few files in a folder with a corresponding README. This will make it easy for participants to explore the files provided because they'll see metadata in context.
