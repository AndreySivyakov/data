## Untapped Oil &amp; Gas Datathon ##

### What Is This? ###
This repository is being used to collect data in advance of the datathon event on October 12th to October 14th, 2018. You can submit data using the data upload tool below if you do not have collaborator access to this repository.

### Data Upload Tool ###

Visit https://sharp-edison-5440cb.netlify.com to access the upload tool. The form accepts any type of file, although it has inexplicably garbled Excel files, so please only use text or CSV. My intention is to add some basic metadata analysis, for instance, detecting the names of columns in CSV files, etc. The metadata (currently just the description you enter in the upload tool) will be placed in a separate file that has the same name as your uploaded data file, but appended with .metadata.txt. For those interested, this tool is built with netlify, serverless (Amazon Lambda), and S3.
