## Untapped Oil &amp; Gas Datathon ##

### What Is This? ###
This repository will be used to collect data in advance of the datathon event on October 12th to October 14th, 2018. You can submit data using the data upload tool below.

### Data Upload Tool ###

See https://sharp-edison-5440cb.netlify.com.

This form accepts any type of file. My intention is to add some basic metadata analysis, for instance, detecting the names of columns in CSV files, etc. The metadata (currently just the description you enter in the upload tool) will be placed in a separate file that has the same name as your uploaded data file, but appended with .metadata.txt.

Very open to suggestions to improve this tool and process! :)
